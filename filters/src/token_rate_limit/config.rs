/// Deserialized YAML config for the `token_rate_limit` filter: an ordered
/// list of `rules`, each binding an optional match condition to an
/// algorithm choice (`sliding_window` or `token_bucket`) and that rule's
/// own budget.
///
/// Experimental: requires the `token-rate-limit-filter` cargo feature,
/// which is off by default and activates the `experimental` marker.
/// This filter delivers the agreed M1/M2/M6/M7 milestone scope, but its
/// parent proposal is not yet `accepted` and open questions remain
/// (HA/clustered-Valkey failure modes, and the relationship to
/// Kuadrant's `TokenRateLimitPolicy` -- see `ai#127`). The
/// configuration surface may change between releases.
///
/// Mirrors the `rules:`/`match:` shape from the `00121_token-rate-limiting`
/// proposal in `praxis-proxy/enhancements`, scoped to this milestone's
/// static header-value matchers, per-rule algorithm choice, configurable
/// estimation strategies (M3, see [`EstimationConfig`]), and M4
/// token-type weights (`default_weights` / per-rule `weights`). CEL
/// matchers and soft-limit tiers are still out of scope (see the module
/// doc comment) -- upstream itself defers those.
///
/// Assumes request identity has already been resolved upstream (this
/// filter doesn't authenticate callers) -- a catch-all rule (no
/// `match:`) reserves quota for every request that reaches it,
/// including probes and health checks. Scope rules with explicit
/// `match:` conditions, or place an identity/auth filter earlier in
/// the pipeline. Tracked as follow-on integration work in `grid#101`.
///
/// Observability is group-level by rule, never by user. Metrics carry only
/// bounded `rule`, `algorithm`, `backend`, `result`, and `capacity` labels;
/// accounting logs and optional OpenTelemetry spans likewise omit raw
/// subject and bucket-key values. The Prometheus contract is:
///
/// - `praxis_trl_requests_total{rule,result}` (`admitted` or `denied`): budget decisions only. Requests rejected before
///   a decision are counted by `praxis_trl_unauthenticated_total` (401, no trusted subject) and
///   `praxis_trl_backend_errors_total` (503, fail closed) instead.
///
/// - `praxis_trl_unauthenticated_total{rule}`
///
/// - `praxis_trl_tokens_reserved_total{rule}`
///
/// - `praxis_trl_tokens_reconciled_total{rule}`
///
/// - `praxis_trl_tokens_refunded_total{rule}`
///
/// - `praxis_trl_tokens_overage_total{rule}`
///
/// - `praxis_trl_reservations_total{rule,result}` (`reconciled` or `orphaned`)
///
/// - `praxis_trl_soft_tier_activations_total{rule,capacity}`
///
/// - `praxis_trl_backend_errors_total{rule,backend}`: failed reservations (the 503 path) and reconciliations abandoned
///   after their retries.
///
/// - `praxis_trl_backend_reconciliation_total{rule,backend,result}`: reconciliations completed by a Valkey worker.
///
/// - `praxis_trl_budget_remaining{rule,algorithm}`
///
/// - `praxis_trl_reservations_active{rule}`
///
/// - `praxis_trl_active_keys{rule}`
///
/// Every previous `praxis_ai_token_rate_limit_*` name has moved to this
/// prefix; no compatibility aliases are emitted.
///
/// `budget_remaining` is the sum of the latest calculated remaining
/// balances for the rule's retained keys, and `active_keys` is how many
/// balances contribute. Window aging and refill are evaluated lazily during
/// normal backend operations, so both are snapshots rather than
/// continuously refreshed values. Like all Prometheus gauges they are f64
/// and saturate at the largest exactly representable integer (2^53 - 1).
///
/// Gauge scope depends on the backend. With the `memory` backend every
/// gauge describes this process only, so aggregate replicas with `sum`.
/// With the `valkey` backend every replica exports the rule-wide value it
/// last observed from the shared store, so aggregate replicas with `max`;
/// a replica that stops seeing traffic for a rule keeps exporting its last
/// observation until it does. Valkey applies expiry incrementally on each
/// admission, so its counts can briefly include entries that have just
/// expired.
///
/// Admissions, denials, reconciliations, and backend failures also emit
/// structured records on the `praxis_ai::token_rate_limit::accounting`
/// tracing target: `INFO` for admissions and settlements, `WARN` for
/// failures. They are on by default at `INFO`, so every admitted or denied
/// request produces one line in the operational log stream; keep only
/// failures with `runtime.log_overrides:
/// {"praxis_ai::token_rate_limit::accounting": "warn"}`, and separate them
/// from other operational logs by filtering on the `target` field. The
/// records contain bounded policy and token-count fields only. They are
/// best-effort operational audit records, not a durable billing source.
