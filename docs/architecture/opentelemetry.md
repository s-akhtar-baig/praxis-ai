# OpenTelemetry Routing Semantics

Praxis AI can add AI routing decisions to the request trace created and
exported by Praxis core. Build the proxy with:

```sh
cargo build --release -p praxis-ai-proxy --features opentelemetry
```

The feature is disabled by default. It does not install an exporter or parse
OpenTelemetry environment variables. Configure exporting, propagation,
sampling, and request lifecycle tracing through Praxis core.

After `intelligent_route` successfully selects a provider, the feature emits a
short `routing.select` child span. The span contains bounded routing identity,
admission, locality, rank, tier, and overlay revision attributes. It never
records request or response bodies, prompts, credentials, authorization
headers, cookies, or session keys.

After `provider_route` validates the edge-selected candidate and resolves it
to a provider-local backend cluster, the feature emits a short `provider.route`
child span. The span records the resolved backend cluster the request was
routed to; it is not proof that a downstream endpoint, pod, or model server
successfully served the request. It contains:

- `provider.id`: the configured provider-boundary identifier for this
  listener. This is a configuration value, not necessarily the mTLS peer
  identity.
- `provider.backend.cluster`: the configured backend cluster the candidate
  resolved to.
- `provider.route.model`: the configured model accepted for the resolved
  route.
- `provider.route.candidate_id`: the edge-selected candidate ID that was
  validated and resolved.
- `overlay.revision`: present only when the edge supplied a serving overlay
  revision that passed syntax and trust-boundary validation. It is
  correlation evidence only, not a provider-local config revision and not an
  authorization decision.

Like `routing.select`, this span never records request or response bodies,
prompts, credentials, authorization headers, cookies, session keys, or raw
request identifiers.

The division of responsibility is intentional:

```text
Edge Praxis core request span
  |
  +-- routing.select          (Praxis AI, intelligent_route)
  `-- upstream hop            (Praxis core)

Provider Praxis core request span
  |
  +-- provider.route          (Praxis AI, provider_route)
  `-- upstream hop            (Praxis core)

Either request span, when its pipeline runs token_rate_limit
  |
  +-- token_rate_limit        (Praxis AI; admission until the response body ends)
  `-- ...
```

The routing decision spans are short-lived siblings of the later transport
span within the same request. The `token_rate_limit` span is the exception:
it opens at admission and is closed when the response body ends, because its
`actual_cost` field is only known once provider usage has been read (see
below). When trace context is propagated between gateways, Praxis core
connects the edge provider-hop client span to the provider request span.

Praxis core owns the complete HTTP span lifetime and transport boundaries at
both the edge and the provider-local listener. Praxis AI records only the
semantic decisions it makes at each hop. This prevents duplicate request
roots, conflicting trace propagation, and multiple exporter runtimes.

Agentic callouts follow the same ownership rule. When a listener enables the
core `trace_context` filter, Praxis AI projects only its typed `TraceContext`
into isolated web-search, OGX file-search, OGX file-resolution, and MCP child
requests. Praxis core then emits the same `x-request-id` and W3C trace ID with a
fresh span ID for every outbound hop. No ambient request extensions, provider
credentials, or MCP authorization assertions are copied into trace fields.

## Token rate limiting

When the experimental `token_rate_limit` filter and the `opentelemetry`
feature are both enabled, every request that reaches a matching rule gets a
request-scoped `token_rate_limit` span. It records these bounded fields:

- `token_rate_limit.rule`: configured rule name.
- `token_rate_limit.algorithm`: `sliding_window` or `token_bucket`.
- `token_rate_limit.estimated_cost`: tokens reserved or considered at admission.
- `token_rate_limit.decision`: `admitted` (reservation made), `denied` (429,
  budget exhausted), `unauthenticated` (401, no trusted subject to key the
  budget on), or `error` (503, the backend failed and the filter failed
  closed).
- `token_rate_limit.actual_cost`: provider-reported weighted usage, recorded
  when the response body ends. Absent when the decision was not `admitted`
  or no usage metadata was produced.

The span is created at admission and dropped when the response body ends,
so its lifetime covers the streamed response. It does not contain the
authenticated subject, internal budget key, prompt, body, model, or other
request-specific identity. Valkey reconciliation runs asynchronously after
response processing; its success or failure is exposed through metrics and
accounting logs rather than extending the span further.
