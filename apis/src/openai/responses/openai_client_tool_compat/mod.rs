//! Compatibility adapter that lets a rich Codex-style Responses client talk to a
//! function-only Responses backend (#1131).
//!
//! Some Responses backends (for example vLLM at `POST /v1/responses`) accept only
//! `type: "function"` tool declarations and only emit `function_call` output
//! items. A Codex client, however, declares richer *client-owned* tools —
//! freeform `custom` tools, `namespace` groupings, a local `shell`, and a
//! client-executed `tool_search` — and expects the matching typed output items
//! back. This filter bridges the two **without** routing through
//! `/v1/chat/completions` and **without** ever executing a client-owned tool
//! inside Praxis.
//!
//! # Request phase — lowering
//!
//! On the outbound request the filter rewrites the client's rich tool
//! declarations into private `function` declarations the backend understands:
//!
//! - `custom` → a `function` whose single string `input` parameter carries the freeform payload; the model-visible
//!   description preserves the declared contract.
//! - `namespace` members (both `function` and `custom`) → flat `function` tools named
//!   `agentic_ns__{namespace}__{member}` (hashed when longer than 64 chars); a `custom` member keeps the single string
//!   `input` contract, and the namespace's required model-visible description is folded into every member so the group
//!   context survives flattening.
//! - local `shell` → a `shell` `function` tool whose description folds in any declared `environment.skills` (name,
//!   description, path) so the model still sees the available local skills.
//! - client-executed `tool_search` → a fixed `tool_search` `function` tool.
//!
//! Matching `tool_choice` selectors and prior typed client-owned items already in
//! the conversation history are lowered the same way so a continuation turn stays
//! valid for a function-only backend. A lowered client tool call's *output* item
//! (for example a `custom_tool_call_output` or `shell_call_output`) becomes a
//! `function_call_output` that carries every representation-compatible field the
//! backend can consume — the correlating `call_id`, the produced `output`, and any
//! schema-valid `id`, `status`, and `caller` — so continuation metadata is not
//! silently dropped.
//!
//! A client-executed `tool_search` that already ran in an earlier turn reports the
//! tools it discovered in a `tool_search_output.tools` array. On a **buffered**
//! continuation those discovered definitions are themselves lowered and hoisted
//! into the outbound `function` set (subject to the same name-collision and
//! tool-cap checks) so the function-only backend can actually call a tool the
//! search surfaced; a discovered tool that collides with an existing name, exceeds
//! the cap, or is itself an unsupported kind fails closed with HTTP 400. A
//! `tool_search_output` whose `status` is `completed`, absent, or null contributes
//! its tools (the field is optional and nullable in the input schema, and a
//! client-supplied continuation history commonly omits it); an explicitly
//! non-terminal or unrecognized status is treated as not-yet-authoritative and
//! contributes nothing. A discovered tool is being loaded now, so its
//! Responses-only `defer_loading` hint is consumed and it becomes callable: a
//! discovered `function` (top level or a `namespace` member) is sanitized to the
//! backend-callable fields (a restrictive `allowed_callers` or malformed
//! `output_schema` fails closed) and a discovered `custom` gains its single-string
//! `input` contract. Conversely, on the rich/discovered lowering path a tool the
//! client declared with `defer_loading: true` — a top-level `function` or `custom`,
//! or a `namespace` member of either kind — is withheld from the outbound set until
//! a search hoists it, so its deferred declaration never collides with its own
//! discovered copy (a request whose rich tools are *all* deferred forwards an empty
//! callable set, its originals echoed back on the response). A request with no rich
//! client tool and no discovered tools instead takes the native passthrough path,
//! which forwards its `function` declarations — including any `defer_loading` hint a
//! function-only backend can honor or ignore — verbatim. The
//! same `(type, name)` redefined across searches with definitions that lower to
//! different backend declarations is ambiguous and fails closed with HTTP 400;
//! listings that differ only in a decorator lowering drops (for example
//! `defer_loading` or a `null` `output_schema`) reduce to one hoisted tool.
//!
//! The lowered names never leak to the client:
//! a per-request reverse map (`LoweredClientTool`) and a verbatim
//! `ClientToolEcho` snapshot of the original `tools`/`tool_choice` are recorded
//! in `ResponsesState` for the response phase.
//!
//! The filter fails closed with HTTP 400 **before any upstream request** on a
//! name collision, an unsupported custom format (a non-`text` constrained
//! `format`), an invalid lowered function name, a
//! `namespace` missing its required `name`/`description`/`tools` or whose member
//! is neither `function` nor `custom`, a local `shell` whose `environment.skills`
//! is `null` or not an array, declares more than the schema maximum of 200
//! entries, or contains a skill missing any of its required string
//! `name`/`description`/`path` fields, a hoisted namespace member or discovered
//! `function` that declares a restrictive `allowed_callers` or a malformed
//! (non-object, non-null) `output_schema`, or a `tool_choice` selector that names
//! an undeclared client tool or whose declared kind disagrees with the member it
//! selects. A rewrite that grows the outbound body past the configured
//! `max_rewritten_body_bytes` — including a history-only continuation whose escaped
//! inputs expand — fails closed with HTTP 413 before any upstream call.
//!
//! ## `local_shell` is not yet supported
//!
//! The legacy `local_shell` tool restores to a distinct `local_shell_call` output
//! shape this adapter does not yet reconstruct. A `local_shell` *declaration* (top
//! level or as a namespace member) fails closed with HTTP 400, and its typed
//! history items (`local_shell_call`/`local_shell_call_output`) are rejected the
//! same way so an earlier turn's unsupported call can never reach a function-only
//! backend unchanged on a continuation. Callers should declare the modern local
//! shell tool (`type: "shell"` with `environment.type: "local"`) instead. Full
//! `local_shell` lowering/restoration is a follow-up.
//!
//! # Response phase — restoration
//!
//! Running immediately before `openai_agentic_loop` on the buffered response, the
//! filter restores each returned `function_call` whose name is in the reverse map
//! back to its canonical typed item (`custom_tool_call`, a namespaced
//! `function_call`, a namespaced `custom_tool_call`, `shell_call`, or
//! `tool_search_call`) and restores
//! `response.tools`/`response.tool_choice` from the echo snapshot. It fails closed
//! with HTTP 502 **before emitting a successful terminal response** when a
//! `shell_call` or `tool_search_call` cannot be reconstructed losslessly
//! (malformed arguments, or a non-completed client tool call).
//!
//! # Streaming
//!
//! On the streaming Responses path (`stream: true`) the lowered client-tool calls
//! are restored **live in the SSE lifecycle** by the `openai_stream_events` logical
//! owner, not by this filter: this filter records the reverse lowering map and the
//! `tools`/`tool_choice` echo snapshot on the request, and `openai_stream_events`
//! re-types each lowered `function_call` as it streams (#1159).
//!
//! That hand-off requires `openai_stream_events` to be placed **before**
//! `openai_client_tool_compat` in the inference step: on the request it publishes a
//! marker arming streaming restoration, which this filter reads before lowering. If
//! a streaming request declares rich client tools (or carries `tool_search`-discovered
//! tools that would be hoisted) but no `openai_stream_events` owner is armed ahead of
//! it, the filter fails closed with **HTTP 500** — an operator misconfiguration —
//! **before any upstream call**, so a private lowered `function` name can never reach
//! an un-restored SSE stream. A streaming request that neither declares rich client
//! tools nor carries discovered tools stays a transparent passthrough.
//!
//! When the request declares no rich client tools and carries no discovered tools
//! the filter is a transparent passthrough, so native traffic is unchanged.
