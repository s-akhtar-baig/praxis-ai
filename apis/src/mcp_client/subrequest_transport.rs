//! Route the outbound MCP Streamable-HTTP exchange through a filtered
//! subrequest.
//!
//! This is the `#957` seam: instead of dialing the MCP server with an inline
//! `reqwest` client, the [`rmcp`] [`StreamableHttpClient`] adapter here targets
//! the dynamic MCP URL through praxis's URL-aware target preparation
//! ([`prepare_url_target`]) and runs the request through a bound outbound
//! [`FilteredSubrequestExecutor`] chain. The chain reuses praxis's own SSRF/DNS
//! validation, TLS/SNI handling, Host binding, deadline, and response-size
//! guardrails rather than reimplementing them per call.
//!
//! Both POST→SSE (client-initiated request/response that may stream) and
//! server-initiated GET SSE streams are supported through the filtered subrequest
//! path. Buffered exchanges (JSON responses) are parsed directly, and streaming
//! `text/event-stream` responses are forwarded incrementally via the SSE byte
//! adapter.
